Creating a "Hello World" console application in C# is quite simple. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Here's what this code does:

1. `using System;` - This is a `using` directive that allows us to use classes from the `System` namespace without having to write their fully qualified name each time.

2. `class Program` - Defines a class named `Program`. This is a basic unit of the program.

3. `static void Main()` - This is the main entry point for the application. The `Main` method can be named anything you like, but by convention, it's usually named "Main".

4. `Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");` - This line actually prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console. `Console` is a class in the `System` namespace, and `WriteLine` is a method of this class that writes the specified string and newline to the console.

5. You can compile and run this program. When you run this program, it will display "Hello, World!" to the console.
